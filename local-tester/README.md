# Algorithm tester

## Setup
Requires Jupyter Notebook to be installed:

    pip install jupyter notebook

Once jupyter notebook has been installed, it can be opened by entering `jupyter notebook` into your CLI

Navigate to the Algo_tester jupyter notebook

## Utilization
When a new kernel stars, all the cells must be run in order. A star in the [] to the upper left of the cell indicated a running cell, and when a number replaces the [*], e.g. [2], the cell has completed running

After changing any settings, you must run the tests again before checking the results
